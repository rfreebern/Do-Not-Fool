Every year on April 1st, people all over the web implement jokes and pranks on their websites. Generally these are
supposed to be funny, but we don't all share the same sense of humor. Some of these jokes are genuinely amusing;
others can be irritating, frustrating, or even make us angry.

There's no reason that those who enjoy pranks can't have fun with this day while still respecting the wishes of
those who don't want to bother with the whole thing. With Mozilla Labs' experimental "Do Not Fool" HTTP request
header, we can achieve harmony.

By encouraging the widespread adoption of the DNF header by April Fools prank authors, I hope to make April Fools
day on the web once again enjoyable for everyone.

Please contribute!

If you are familiar with a web development language, platform, or framework not represented here, please take a
few minutes to contribute. Anything from a code snippet to a full-fledged library is welcome.

If you're not sure what to do, it's simple: your code merely needs to check if the HTTP request contains a header
with the name "DNF". If it does and the value of that header is "1", the visitor doesn't want to see April Fools
jokes. If the value is "0", or the header doesn't exist, then feel free to present the joke.
