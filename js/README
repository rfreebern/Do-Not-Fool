April Fools pranks that are entirely javascript can't read the request headers, and therefore will be inflicted on those
who don't want to see them. The greasemonkey user script here sets a window-level variable, window.__DNF, which scripts
on the page can check. If it's set to 1, the script should abort without executing the joke.

Ideally, the greasemonkey script could read the preference set by the Do Not Fool extension; unfortunately, greasemonkey
scripts only have access to the preferences they've set themselves. This is obviously not the best solution, but is
provided merely as a starting point for discussion of this issue.
